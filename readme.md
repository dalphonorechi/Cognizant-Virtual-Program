# Cognizant Virtual Experience Program.


## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis.

#### 1. Analyze data.

Once the dataset was scrapped, data cleaning was performed in order to prepare the data for analysis. 

#### 2. Present insights.

I summarised my findings within a single [word document](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Cognizant-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/eda.docxx). 


## Task 2 : Project Overview.

An overview on how the project would be executed in a [Powerpoint Presentation](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/KPMG-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/PROJECT%20OVERVIEW.pptx)


## Task 3 : Predicting Stock Percentage.

#### 1.Explore and prepare the dataset.

I explored the dataset, to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then, I prepared the dataset for a predictive model. 

#### 2.Train a machine learning model.

I trained a RandomForestRegressor model on the data.

#### 3.Evaluate model and present findings.

I created a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, I summarised my findings in a [Powerpoint Presentation](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Cognizant-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/MODELLING%20RESULTS.pptx).

## Task 4 : Develop Machine Learning Algorithm For Production.

The modelling code was prepared into production ready [python file](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Cognizant-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/model.py).
